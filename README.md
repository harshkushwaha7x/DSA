## Overview

This repository is designed to provide clear and efficient implementations of data structures and algorithms commonly used in software development. All code is written in Java, and the repository is structured to enable easy navigation and understanding.

The goal is to make it easier for learners to experiment with and visualize data structures and algorithms while providing detailed explanations and well-organized code.

## Data Structures

### Arrays
- Implementations of various array-based operations, such as searching, insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List**: Basic operations like insert, delete, search, etc.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Bidirectional traversal with insertion and deletion at both ends.

### Stacks
- Stack operations implemented with both arrays and linked lists.

### Queues
- Queue operations, including standard queue, circular queue, and priority queue.

### Trees
- **Binary Tree**: Basic operations such as in-order, pre-order, post-order traversal.
- **Binary Search Tree**: Efficient search, insertion, and deletion.
- **AVL Tree**: Self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Heap**: Min-Heap and Max-Heap implementations.

### Graphs
- Representing graphs using adjacency lists and matrices.
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) implementations.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

### Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search** (on sorted arrays)

### Graph Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Shortest path in a weighted graph.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Minimum Spanning Tree.
- **Prim's Algorithm**: Minimum Spanning Tree.

### Dynamic Programming
- **Knapsack Problem**
- **Fibonacci Sequence**
- **Longest Common Subsequence**
- **Coin Change Problem**

## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-java.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd dsa-java
    ```

3. Compile and run any Java file using the following command:
    ```bash
    javac <filename>.java
    java <filename>
    ```

You can explore the individual files in the `src` folder to find different data structures and algorithms.
