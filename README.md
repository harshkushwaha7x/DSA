# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms in Java 💻

**Data Structures and Algorithms in Java** is a comprehensive, step-wise Java DSA roadmap using clean code, real-world DSA problems, and detailed explanations for learning, interviews, and practice. Each topic is organized into folders by Step and Lecture, with hundreds of solved LeetCode/GFG-style problems.

## 📁 Actual Project Structure

The repository organizes solutions step-by-step, mirroring a guided learning roadmap for DSA. Each "Step" folder targets a major topic, subdivided by difficulty or lecture. Example layout:

- `Step 1  Learn the basics/`
  - `basics.java`
- `Step 2  Learn Important Sorting Techniques/`
  - `Sorting.java`
- `Step 3  Solve Problems on Arrays/`
  - `Lec 1 Easy/arrays.java`
  - `Lec 2 Medium/arrays.java`
  - `Lec 3 Hard/arrays.java`
- `Step 4  Binary Search [1D, 2D Arrays, Search Space]/`
  - `Lec 1 BS on 1D Arrays/BinarySearch.java`
  - ...
- `Step 5  Strings/`
  - `Lec 1 Basic and Easy String Problems/strings.java`
  - `Lec 2 Medium String Problems/strings.java`
- `Step 6  Learn LinkedList [Single LL, Double LL, Medium, Hard Problems]/`
  - `Lec 1–5/linkedlist.java`
- ...
- `Step 15  Graphs [Concepts & Problems]/`
  - e.g., BFS, DFS, Topological Sort, Minimum Spanning Tree, etc.
- `Step 16  Dynamic Programming [Patterns and Problems]/`
  - `Lec 2–9/Dynamic_Programming.java`

Every folder represents a chronological learning step, with relevant `.java` files organized by subtopic or difficulty. Each file typically contains multiple class solutions for several problems on that theme. See folder names for the specific topic or pattern covered in each step.

## 🛠️ Quick Start (Run Any Solution)

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshkushwaha7x/DSA.git
cd DSA
```
2. **Navigate to any Step/Lecture folder**
```bash
cd "Step 3 Solve Problems on Arrays/Lec 1 Easy"
```
3. **Compile the Java file:**
```bash
javac arrays.java
```
4. **Run the main (if present) or your own test harness:**
```bash
java arrays # Typical if 'public static void main' is present
```
**Note:** Most files use *class-per-problem* format. Add your own `main()` if absent to test a solution.

## 📚 Topics & Organization (Sample Steps)
- **Step 1:** Language/Java basics, Tries/strings/arrays
- **Step 2:** Classic Sorting (Selection, Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap)
- **Step 3:** Array pattern problems (largest, second largest, rotation, union, longest subarray, etc)
- **Step 4:** Binary Search (1D/2D, bounds, peak elements, special variants)
- **Step 5:** Strings (easy/medium, anagrams, manipulation)
- **Step 6:** Linked Lists (SLL, DLL, cycles, intersection, palindrome, etc)
- **Step 7:** Recursion (patterns, subsets, hard combos)
- **...**
- **Step 16:** Dynamic Programming (1D, 2D, subsequences, stocks, LIS, MCM, etc)
- **Step 18:** Advanced/hard string problems

Each `Step x <Topic>` folder contains one or more `.java` files with classes for each typical LeetCode/GFG-style DSA problem of that type.

## 📖 Running & Customizing
- Use any Java compiler or IDE.
- Edit/add your own `main()` for custom testing.
- Each step/lecture source is standalone — you don't need external libraries.
- **Testing:** No formal `/tests` or JUnit at this time. Feel free to add and PR!

---

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions for new problems, additional code comments, bug fixes, and JUnit test harnesses are very welcome!

- Use the existing folder/step structure.
- Add new solutions as new methods/classes inside the relevant step or as a new file if a distinct topic.
- Document each class/problem, add sample input/output where possible.
- PRs for test suites and improved navigation/readability are appreciated!

**To contribute:**
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-solution`)
3. Commit and push your changes
4. Open a Pull Request and explain your additions/fixes
