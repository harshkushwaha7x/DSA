# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms in Java 💻

**Data Structures and Algorithms in Java** is a comprehensive, step-wise Java DSA roadmap using clean code, real-world DSA problems, and detailed explanations for learning, interviews, and practice. Each topic is organized into folders by Step and Lecture, with hundreds of solved LeetCode/GFG-style problems.

## 🛠️ Quick Start (Run Any Solution)

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshkushwaha7x/DSA.git
cd DSA
```
2. **Navigate to any Step/Lecture folder**
```bash
cd "Step 3 Solve Problems on Arrays/Lec 1 Easy"
```
3. **Compile the Java file:**
```bash
javac arrays.java
```
4. **Run the main (if present) or your own test harness:**
```bash
java arrays # Typical if 'public static void main' is present
```
**Note:** Most files use *class-per-problem* format. Add your own `main()` if absent to test a solution.

- **Step 3:** Problems on Arrays (largest, second largest, rotation, union, subarrays, prefix sum, etc.)
- **Step 4:** Binary Search (on 1D/2D arrays, search space, special variants)
- **Step 5:** Strings (basic/medium, anagrams, substring and manipulation problems)
- **Step 6:** Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, cycles, intersection, palindrome, operations)
- **Step 7:** Recursion (core patterns, subsets, combinations, backtracking, hard combos)
- **Step 8:** Bit Manipulation (all concepts, set/clear bits, advanced math, bit tricks)
- **Step 9:** Stack and Queues (stack basics, prefix/infix/postfix, monotonic stack, queue implementations)
- **Step 10:** Sliding Window & Two Pointer Techniques (easy, medium, and hard window/pointer problems)
- **Step 11:** Heaps (learning heap, priority queue, min/max heap, heap problems)
- **Step 12:** Greedy Algorithms (classic greedy, easy to medium-hard level problems)
- **Step 13:** Binary Trees (traversals, easy/medium/hard tree problems)
- **Step 14:** Binary Search Trees (BST operations, validation, LCA, kth smallest/largest, construction & more)
- **Step 15:** Graphs (representation, BFS/DFS, topological sort, shortest path algorithms, MST, disjoint sets, flood fill, cycle detection)

- **Step 18:** Strings (Advanced/Hard string pattern problems, automata, and tricky algorithms)

Each `Step x <Topic>` folder contains one or more `.java` files with classes for each typical LeetCode/GFG-style DSA problem of that type.

## 📖 Running & Customizing
- Use any Java compiler or IDE.
- Edit/add your own `main()` for custom testing.
- Each step/lecture source is standalone — you don't need external libraries.
- **Testing:** No formal `/tests` or JUnit at this time. Feel free to add and PR!

---

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions for new problems, additional code comments, bug fixes, and JUnit test harnesses are very welcome!

- Use the existing folder/step structure.
- Add new solutions as new methods/classes inside the relevant step or as a new file if a distinct topic.
- Document each class/problem, add sample input/output where possible.
- PRs for test suites and improved navigation/readability are appreciated!

**To contribute:**
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-solution`)
3. Commit and push your changes
4. Open a Pull Request and explain your additions/fixes
